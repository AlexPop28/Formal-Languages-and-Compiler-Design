I will use one symbol table for both identifiers and constants. It is
implemented using a hash table (named =Indexed_hashset= in the code due to it
not having an explicit value associated with the key, but rather an index that
can be used to retrieve a key if it exists). It provides two functions, namely
=add_symbol= and =get_symbol= for adding a new symbol (and getting its index
back) and retrieving a symbol using its index (if it is valid), respectively.
The hashing function used is a polynomial hash based on the ASCII codes of the
characters and conflict resolution is done by open addressing.
